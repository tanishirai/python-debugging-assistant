# Python Screening Task 2: Debugging Assistant Prompt

 

## ðŸ“Œ Prompt

The debugging prompt is available in [`Prompt.md`](./Prompt.md).

 

---

 

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Objective

The task was to create a clear, natural-language prompt that guides an AI assistant to help students debug their Python code. The assistant should:

- Explain what the code is doing

- Point out likely issues

- Provide hints and strategies

- Avoid giving the final corrected solution

## ðŸ“– Reasoning

 

### Why written this way

I kept the prompt natural and teacher-like, so it doesnâ€™t sound mechanical. The focus is on guiding the student to think about their own code, instead of simply fixing it for them. The wording makes the assistant act like a mentor â€” supportive and clear.

 

### How it avoids giving solutions

The prompt explicitly says not to provide corrected code. Instead, it stresses hints, questions, and debugging steps. This way, the AI can guide without spoiling the learning process.

 

### Tone and style

The assistant should sound friendly and encouraging, not strict or robotic. The aim is to keep students motivated while also making them think critically about their mistakes.

 

### Balance between bug spotting and guidance

The assistant should highlight areas of concern but not rewrite the code. By asking guiding questions, the student stays in control of the solution. Debugging tips (like printing values or checking assumptions) build independence.

 

### Beginner vs. advanced learners

- **Beginners**: Use plain English, simple examples, and concrete debugging tips.  

- **Advanced learners**: Use more technical language, focus on deeper reasoning, edge cases, and efficiency.
